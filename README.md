# Manga Website Project  

**Live Demo:** [Manga Website](https://alyasometimeshidesherfeelingsmanga.framer.website/)  

At age 16, I built a fully functional, responsive manga reading website in just **ONE DAY** using [Framer](https://framer.com). Inspired by the manga **"Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian"**, this project demonstrates the power of rapid prototyping and modern web design.

## 📖 About the Build
This project was built during a **summer vacation** out of boredom 😅.  
The challenge? Completed in **just one day** using Figma(Design), Framer(development & deployment), third-party integrations, and problem-solving skills.
The idea? To create many manga reading websites and a platform for monetization. But... it never went live because the manga artist would probably sue me for copyright infringement 🙂. Now it's just a live project.
